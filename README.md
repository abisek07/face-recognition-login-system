# face-recognition-login-system
A face recognition login system using Python, Open-CV for Microsoft Engage 2022.
## ENGAGE2022
This is my project under Microsoft Engage 2022 Mentorship programme aimed at using Computer Vision to detect a face to log in any account or device for device security. The project is built using tkinter and the detector is pretty accurate. This project can be used in login of accounts or devices with minimal work.
